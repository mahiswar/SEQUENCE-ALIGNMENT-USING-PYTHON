# SEQUENCE-ALIGNMENT-USING-PYTHON
I leverage Biopython to conduct global sequence alignment, focusing on the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. This project empowers me to compare biological sequences like DNA or proteins, determining their optimal alignment  through a scoring system. Proficiency in bioinformatics concepts and Biopython usage is crucial for successful implementation.
